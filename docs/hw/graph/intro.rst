The NULL object

.. todo:: write me


The graphics context
====================

.. todo:: write something here


Channel context
---------------

The following information makes up non-volatile graphics context. This state
is per-channel and thus will apply to all objects on it, unless software does
trap-swap-restart trickery with object switches. It is guaranteed to be
unaffected by subchannel switches and object binds. Some of this state can be
set by submitting methods on the context objects, some can only be set by
accessing PGRAPH context registers.

- the beta factor - set by BETA object
- the 8-bit raster operation - set by ROP object
- the A1R10G10B10 color for chroma key - set by CHROMA object
- the A1R10G10B10 color for plane mask - set by PLANE object
- the user clip rectangle - set by CLIP object:

  - ???

- the pattern state - set by PATTERN object:

  - shape: 8x8, 64x1, or 1x64
  - 2x A8R10G10B10 pattern color
  - the 64-bit pattern itself

- the NOTIFY DMA object - pointer to DMA object used by NOTIFY methods.
  NV1 only - moved to graph object options on NV3+. Set by direct PGRAPH
  access only.
- the main DMA object - pointer to DMA object used by IFM and ITM objects.
  NV1 only - moved to graph object options on NV3+. Set by direct PGRAPH
  access only.
- On NV1, framebuffer setup - set by direct PGRAPH access only:

  - ???

- On NV3+, rendering surface setup:

  - ???

  There are 4 copies of this state, one for each surface used by PGRAPH:

  - DST - the 2d destination surface
  - SRC - the 2d source surface [used by BLIT object only]
  - COLOR - the 3d color surface
  - ZETA - the 3d depth surface

  Note that the M2MF source/destination, ITM destination, IFM/SIFM source,
  and D3D texture don't count as surfaces - even though they may be
  configured to access the same data as surfaces on NV3+, they're accessed
  through the DMA circuitry, not the surface circuitry, and their setup
  is part of volatile state.

.. todo:: NV3 surface setup

.. todo:: update for NV4+


Graph object options
--------------------

In addition to the per-channel state, there is also per-object non-volatile
state, called graph object options. This state is stored in the RAMHT entry
for the object [NV1], or in a RAMIN structure [NV3-]. On subchannel switches
and object binds, the PFIFO will send this state [NV1] or the pointer to this
state [NV3-] to PGRAPH via method 0. On NV1:NV4, this state cannot be
modified by any object methods and requires RAMHT/RAMIN access to change.
On NV4+, PGRAPH can bind DMA objects on its own when requested via methods,
and update the DMA object pointers in RAMIN. On NV5+, PGRAPH can modify
most of this state when requested via methods. All NV4+ automatic options
modification methods can be disabled by software, if so desired.

The graph options contain the following information:

 - :ref:`2d pipeline configuration <graph-2d-pipe-config>`
 - :ref:`2d color and mono format <graph-2d-format-config>`
 - NOTIFY_VALID flag - if set, NOTIFY method will be enabled. If unset, NOTIFY
   method will cause an interrupt. Can be used by the driver to emulate
   per-object DMA_NOTIFY setting - this flag will be set on objects whose
   emulated DMA_NOTIFY value matches the one currently in PGRAPH context,
   and interrupt will cause a switch of the PGRAPH context value followed
   by a method restart.
 - SUBCONTEXT_ID - a single-bit flag that can be used to emulate more than
   one PGRAPH context on one channel. When an object is bound and its
   SUBCONTEXT_ID doesn't match PGRAPH's current SUBCONTEXT_ID, a context
   switch interrupt is raised to allow software to load an alternate context.

.. todo:: NV3+

See :ref:`nv1-pgraph` for detailed format.


Volatile state
--------------

In addition to the non-volatile state described above, PGRAPH also has plenty
of "volatile" state. This state deals with the currently requested operation
and may be destroyed by switching to a new subchannel or binding a new object
[though not by full channel switches - the channels are supposed to be
independent after all, and kernel driver is supposed to save/restore all
state, including volatile state].

Volatile state is highly object-specific, but common stuff is listed here:

 - the "notifier write pending" flag and requested notification type

.. todo:: more stuff?


Notifiers
=========

The notifiers are 16-byte memory structures accessed via DMA objects, used
for synchronization. Notifiers are written by PGRAPH when certain operations
are completed. Software can poll on the memory structure, waiting for it
to be written by PGRAPH. The notifier structure is:

base+0x0:
    64-bit timestamp - written by PGRAPH with current PTIMER time as of
    the notifier write. The timestamp is a concatenation of current
    values of :ref:`TIME_LOW and TIME_HIGH registers <ptimer-time>`
    When big-endian mode is in effect, this becomes a 64-bit
    big-endian number as expected.
base+0x8:
    32-bit word always set to 0 by PGRAPH. This field may be used by
    software to put a non-0 value for software-written error-caused
    notifications.
base+0xc:
    32-bit word always set to 0 by PGRAPH. This is used for
    synchronization - the software is supposed to set this field to
    a non-0 value before submitting the notifier write request,
    then wait for it to become 0. Since the notifier fields are written
    in order, it is guaranteed that the whole notifier structure has
    been written by the time this field is set to 0.

There are two types of notifiers: ordinary notifiers [NV1-] and M2MF notifiers
[NV3-]. Normal notifiers are written when explicitely requested by the NOTIFY
method, M2MF notifiers are written on M2MF transfer completion. M2MF notifiers
cannot be turned off, thus it's required to at least set up a notifier DMA
object if M2MF is used, even if the software doesn't wish to use notifiers
for synchronization.

.. todo:: describe GF100+ notifiers

The notifiers are always written to the currently bound notifier DMA object.
The M2MF notifiers share the DMA object with ordinary notifiers. The layout
of the DMA object used for notifiers is fixed:

- 0x00: ordinary notifier #0
- 0x10: M2MF notifier [NV3-]
- 0x20: ordinary notifier #2 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x30: ordinary notifier #3 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x40: ordinary notifier #4 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x50: ordinary notifier #5 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x60: ordinary notifier #6 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x70: ordinary notifier #7 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x80: ordinary notifier #8 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0x90: ordinary notifier #9 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xa0: ordinary notifier #10 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xb0: ordinary notifier #11 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xc0: ordinary notifier #12 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xd0: ordinary notifier #13 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xe0: ordinary notifier #14 [NV3:NV4 only]
- 0xf0: ordinary notifier #15 [NV3:NV4 only]

.. todo:: 0x20 - NV20 warning notifier?

Note that the notifiers always have to reside at the very beginning of the DMA
object. On NV1 and NV4+, this effectively means that only 1 notifier of each
type can be used per DMA object, requiring mulitple DMA objects if more than
one notifier per type is to be used, and likely requiring a dedicated DMA
object for the notifiers. On NV3:NV4, up to 15 ordinary notifiers may be used
in a single DMA object, though that DMA object likely still needs to be
dedicated for notifiers, and only one of the notifiers supports interrupt
generation.


NOTIFY method
-------------

Ordinary notifiers are requested via the NOTIFY method. Note that the NOTIFY
method schedules a notifier write on completion of the method *following* the
NOTIFY - NOTIFY merely sets "a notifier write is pending" state.

It is an error if a NOTIFY method is followed by another NOTIFY method,
a DMA_NOTIFY method, an object bind, or a subchannel switch.

In addition to a notifier write, the NOTIFY method may also request a NOTIFY
interrupt to be triggered on PGRAPH after the notifier write.

mthd 0x104: NOTIFY [all NV1:GF100 graph objects]
  Requests a notifier write and maybe an interrupt. The write/interrupt will
  be actually performed after the *next* method completes. Possible parameter
  values are:
    0: WRITE - write ordinary notifier #0
    1: WRITE_AND_AWAKEN - write ordinary notifier 0, then trigger NOTIFY
       interrupt [NV3-]
    2: WRITE_2 - write ordinary notifier #2 [NV3:NV4]
    3: WRITE_3 - write ordinary notifier #3 [NV3:NV4]
    [...]
    15: WRITE_15 - write ordinary notifier #15 [NV3:NV4]
Operation::
    if (!cur_grobj.NOTIFY_VALID) {
        /* DMA notify object not set, or needs to be swapped in by sw */
        throw(INVALID_NOTIFY);
    } else if ((param > 0 && gpu == NV1)
            || (param > 15 && gpu >= NV3 && gpu < NV4)
            || (param > 1 && gpu >= NV4)) {
        /* XXX: what state is changed? */
        throw(INVALID_VALUE);
    } else if (NOTIFY_PENDING) {
        /* tried to do two NOTIFY methods in row */
        /* XXX: what state is changed? */
        throw(DOUBLE_NOTIFY);
    } else {
        NOTIFY_PENDING = 1;
        NOTIFY_TYPE = param;
    }

After every method other than NOTIFY and DMA_NOTIFY, the following is done::

    if (NOTIFY_PENDING) {
        int idx = NOTIFY_TYPE;
        if (idx == 1)
            idx = 0;
        dma_write64(NOTIFY_DMA, idx*0x10+0x0, PTIMER.TIME_HIGH << 32 | PTIMER.TIME_LOW);
        dma_write32(NOTIFY_DMA, idx*0x10+0x8, 0);
        dma_write32(NOTIFY_DMA, idx*0x10+0xc, 0);
        if (NOTIFY_TYPE == 1)
            irq_trigger(NOTIFY);
        NOTIFY_PENDING = 0;
    }

if a subchannel switch or object bind is done while NOTIFY_PENDING is set,
CTXSW_NOTIFY error is raised.

NOTE: NV1 has a 1-bit NOTIFY_PENDING field, allowing it to do notifier writes
with interrupts, but lacks support for setting it via the NOTIFY method. This
functionality thus has to be emulated by the driver if needed.


DMA_NOTIFY method
-----------------

On NV4+, the notifier DMA object can be bound by submitting the DMA_NOTIFY
method. This functionality can be disabled by the driver in PGRAPH settings
registers if not desired.

mthd 0x180: DMA_NOTIFY [all NV4:GF100 graph objects]
  Sets the notifier DMA object. When submitted through PFIFO, this method
  will undergo handle -> address translation via RAMHT.
Operation::
    if (DMA_METHODS_ENABLE) {
        /* XXX: list the validation checks */
        NOTIFY_DMA = param;
    } else {
        throw(INVALID_METHOD);
    }


NOP method
----------

On NV4+ a NOP method was added to enable asking for a notifier write without
having to submit an actual method to the object. The NOP method does nothing,
but still counts as a graph object method and will thus trigger a notifier
write/interrupt if one was previously requested.

mthd 0x100: NOP [all NV4+ graph objects]
  Does nothing.
Operation::
    /* nothing */
